# # Decorators Factories

If we want to `customize how a decorator is applied to a declaration`, we can write a decorator factory. A Decorator Factory is simply `a function that returns the expression` that will be called by the decorator at runtime

```
  function color(value: string) {
    // this is the decorator factory, it sets up
    // the returned decorator function
    return function (target) {
      // this is the decorator
      // do something with 'target' and 'value'...
    };
  }
```
