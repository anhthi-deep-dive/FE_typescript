# # Member Visibility

## public

```
  class Greeter {
    public greet() {
      console.log("hi!");
    }
  }
  const g = new Greeter();
  g.greet();
```

## protected

Protected members are `only visible to subclasses` of the class they’re declared in

```
  class Greeter {
    public greet() {
      console.log("Hello, " + this.getName());
    }
    protected getName() {
      return "hi";
    }
  }

  class SpecialGreeter extends Greeter {
    public howdy() {
      console.log("Howdy, " + this.getName()); // allow to access
    }
  }

  const g = new SpecialGreeter();
  g.greet();
  g.getName(); // Property 'getName' is protected and only accessible within class 'Greeter' and its subclasses
```

## private

Private is like protected, but `doesn’t allow access to the member` even `from subclasses`

```
  class Base {
    private x = 0;
  }

  const b = new Base();
  console.log(b.x); // Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.
```
