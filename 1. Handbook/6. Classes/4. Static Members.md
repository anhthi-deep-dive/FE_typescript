# # Static Members

These members `arenâ€™t associated` with a particular `instance of the class`. They can be `accessed through the class constructor object` itself

```
  class MyClass {
    static x = 0;
    static printX() {
      console.log(MyClass.x);
    }
  }
  console.log(MyClass.x);
  MyClass.printX();
```
